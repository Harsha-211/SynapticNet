# SynapticNet with NeuronGenesis ðŸ§ 

SynapticNet with NeuronGenesis is a **continual learning architecture** inspired by the brainâ€™s ability to preserve past knowledge while learning new tasks.  
It prevents **catastrophic forgetting** by dividing the network into **task-specific neuron slices** and adaptively **growing new neurons** when needed.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features

- **Neuron Gating** â€“ Activates only the neurons assigned to the current task.
- **Vertical Slicing** â€“ Allocates fixed neuron segments for each task to avoid interference.
- **Freezing Mechanism** â€“ Locks learned weights for old tasks to preserve knowledge.
- **NeuronGenesis** â€“ Dynamically adds new neurons or layers when performance drops.
- **Multi-task Support** â€“ Works with datasets like **MNIST**, **FashionMNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, and **CIFAR-100**.

## ðŸ§ª Epperimental Results
- **Tested on** - MNIST and FashionMNIST
- **Training Strategy** - Each dataset was trained separately to simulate continual learning
- **Performance** - Achieved high accuracy on both datasets while maintaining previously learned task performance.
